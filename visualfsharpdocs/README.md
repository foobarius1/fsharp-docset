# NOTE - FROZEN CONTENT

The content of this repository is frozen.

All conceptual documentation (guides, language reference, compiler and F# Interactive reference) are actively maintained [here](https://github.com/dotnet/docs), with a [live set on docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/).

All reference content for FSharp.Core will be migrated over to docs.microsoft.com soon, and regular contributions will be accepted in the same repository as the conceptual content (and any changes to that will be reflected here).
